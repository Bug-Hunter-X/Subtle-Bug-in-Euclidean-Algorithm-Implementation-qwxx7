# Subtle Bug in Euclidean Algorithm Implementation

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Go implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). The code appears correct at first glance, but it contains a flaw that can lead to incorrect results under specific conditions.

The `bug.go` file contains the buggy implementation. The `bugSolution.go` file provides a corrected version, along with an explanation of the bug and its fix.

This example is useful for illustrating the importance of careful testing and edge-case consideration in software development.
